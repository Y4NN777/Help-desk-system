# Introduction to Computational Thinking
## Using Our Help Desk System Project as a Case Study

## What is Computational Thinking?

Computational thinking is a problem-solving approach that enables us to formulate problems and their solutions in a way that can be effectively carried out by a human or computer. It's not just about coding - it's a fundamental skill for everyone, helping us tackle complex problems systematically.

## The Four Key Phases of Computational Thinking

### 1. Problem Identification
**Definition:** Clearly defining and understanding the problem you're trying to solve.

**Our Help Desk Example:** We identified our problem as creating a help desk system that allows users to report issues, track progress, and enables agents to respond efficiently while providing analytical capabilities.

### 2. Decomposition
**Definition:** Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts.

**Our Help Desk Example:** We decomposed our help desk system into several components:
- Web platform (using Laravel)
- User Application 
- Authentication system
- Database models
- Python data analysis module
- API layer

### 3. Pattern Recognition
**Definition:** Finding similarities or patterns among small, decomposed problems that can help us solve them more efficiently.

**Our Help Desk Example:** We recognized patterns in:
- User-role based control systems similar to other applications
- Standard ticketing workflows with ticket creation, assignment, resolution
- Common reporting needs for technical support systems

### 4. Abstraction
**Definition:** Focusing on the important information only, ignoring irrelevant details.

**Our Help Desk Example:** We abstracted our system to focus on:
- Core ticket management functionality
- Essential user and agent interactions
- Key data points needed for analytics
- Basic integration requirements

## The Role of Graphic Organizers in Computational Thinking

Graphic organizers are visual representations that help structure information and thinking processes. They're particularly useful in computational thinking because they:

1. Visualize complex systems and their components
2. Illustrate relationships between different parts
3. Show the progression of ideas through iterations
4. Make abstract concepts more concrete

## Our Project's Approach: The Iterations

### Iteration 1 (Main Problem)
In our first iteration, we defined the basic help desk system with:
- Core functionality for users to report issues
- Basic ticket tracking capabilities
- Simple agent response workflows

We decomposed this into:
- Web platform (Laravel)
- User Application
- Python data analysis module

### Iteration 2 (Refined Main Problem)
In our second iteration, we refined our concept by:
- Adding more detail about agent capabilities
- Specifying user request history features
- Including notification systems
- Defining analytics requirements
- Adding API integration for interoperability

We decomposed this further by adding:
- API connected to SQL database
- More specific data analysis requirements

### Decomposition of Sub-Problem (Image 3)
The third image represents a deeper decomposition of one of our sub-problems. From our main decomposition, we took the web platform component and further broke it down into:
- Authentication system with user-role based control
- MySQL database and APIs for data persistence
- Intuitive and visual User Interface

This demonstrates how computational thinking is recursive - we can apply the same process to each sub-problem we identify.

## Applying the Four Phases to Your Work

When approaching your part of the project, follow these phases:

1. **Problem Identification:** Clearly define what specific problem your component solves
2. **Decomposition:** Break down your component into smaller, manageable parts
3. **Pattern Recognition:** Look for similar solutions or approaches for your component
4. **Abstraction:** Focus on the essential functionality, ignoring implementation details initially

## Next Steps for Our Team

Now that we've established the foundations through computational thinking and graphic organizers:

1. Each team member should identify which component they'll be working on
2. Use the graphic organizer approach to work through all four phases
3. Create your own iteration process, refining your ideas
4. Share your work with the team for feedback

## Example Workflow

Here's how you might apply the process to your component:

1. **Problem Identification:** "I need to create an authentication system for the help desk"
2. **Decomposition:** Break this down into:
   - User registration/login
   - Role-based permissions
   - Secure password management
   - Session handling
3. **Pattern Recognition:** Research standard authentication patterns in Laravel
4. **Abstraction:** Focus on the core authentication flow, leaving advanced features for later

## Conclusion

By following the four key phases of computational thinking (problem identification, decomposition, pattern recognition, and abstraction), we've created a solid foundation for our help desk system. The graphic organizers visualize this process and serve as blueprints for our continued work.

Remember that computational thinking is iterative - we'll continue to apply these phases as we refine our solutions and tackle new challenges within the project.
